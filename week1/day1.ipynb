    "## If you're new to Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the wonderful world of Data Science experimentation! Once you've used Jupyter Lab, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Simply click in each \"cell\" with code in it, such as the cell immediately below this text, and hit Shift+Return to execute that cell. As you wish, you can add a cell with the + button in the toolbar, and print values of variables, or try out variations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I've written a notebook called [Guide to Jupyter](Guide%20to%20Jupyter.ipynb) to help you get more familiar with Jupyter Labs, including adding Markdown comments, using `!` to run shell commands, and `tqdm` to show progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer to work in IDEs like VSCode or Pycharm, they both work great with these lab notebooks too.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## If you'd like to brush up your Python\n",
    "\n",
    "I've added a notebook called [Intermediate Python](Intermediate%20Python.ipynb) to get you up to speed. But you should give it a miss if you already have a good idea what this code does:    \n",

    "## More troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see the [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.ipynb) notebook in this folder to diagnose and fix common problems.\n",

    "## If this is old hat!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're already comfortable with today's material, please hang in there; you can move swiftly through the first few labs - we will get much more in depth as the weeks progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business value of these exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "A final thought. While I've designed these notebooks to be educational, I've also tried to make them enjoyable. We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me."
